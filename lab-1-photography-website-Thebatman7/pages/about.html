            Peter Benjamin Parker was born in New York City, New York on May 25, 2001, where he was raised until the age of 6 when his parents were killed in an airplane crash overseas. 
            He then went to live with his uncle and aunt Ben and May Parker, in Forest Hills, New York. Parker was extremely bright and became a high honors student at Midtown High School.
            Parker's shyness and scholastic interest often made him a social outcast. He picked up photopgraphy as a way to make ends meet. As a poor college student he needed a source of income.
            He turned out to be good at photopgraphy. This allowed poor Peter an oportunity to get out of his shell. He has now over 10 years of experience in photography and he has become a great photographer.
