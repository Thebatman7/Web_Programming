         Peter is a great photographer. He has excellent observation to check all the details in a photograph.
         He is able to observe every necessary detail before clicking a picture.

        In my opinion he is one of the best photographers out there. As my unofficial photographer he has done an excellent job.
        He captures my heroism and what I stand for. I would definitely recommend.

        He is a very good photographer. Although, I do not like his attitude he is alwasy happy and hopeful.
        He can be hard to work with, but I would definitely recommend because the quality of his work is excellent.
